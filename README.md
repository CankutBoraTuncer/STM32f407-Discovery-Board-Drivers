# STM32f407-Discovery-Board-Drivers
During my time at the Digital Transformation Department of Savronik, I was tasked to write GPIO, SPI, I2C, and UART drivers for the development board based on the STM32 microcontroller. They had several peripheral sensors to be used in simulations developed by the team, and they were looking for alternatives for more portable and power-efficient microcontrollers. I used the STMs own IDE, STM32Cube, while writing the code. The go-to language was the C language.
